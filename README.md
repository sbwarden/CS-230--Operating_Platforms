### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements

The client was the CEO, Liam, of a small business and their lead IT manager, Ian. The CEO had an idea to capitalize on the lack of industry for teaching teens to pass the drivers test. He wanted to create a web-based product that would offer online practice tests and allow for scheduling of individual driving sessions with specific instructors. They were a smaller company and therefore wanted to use a cloud service provider to run off of that would handle the security and storage necessities. We were tasked with designing a software that would allow each type of user different levels of access to all of the information, and that would update with internet software updates on each web-enabled device.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that my executive summary and ability to take the overall grasp of the company needs and translate them into a document that both business and data employees will understand. I spent a good amount of time writing and restructuring my eplanation of the Linux architeture and security plans so I would say those as well.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having already written out the overall purpose and organizing the needs of the software, both functional and non-functional, was extremely beneficial to me. In previous classes and projects, I have had to repeatedly return to the original business discussion documents to figure out which parts I still needed to accomplish and when. Having essentially created an outline ahead of time meant there were only a handful of times I felt the need to return to the full transcript again.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I realized early on that the mobile option was not actually a usable choice on any aspect. Once I had decided that I took decidedly less time and effort into researching that section since I knew it was not a viable option. In hindsight, I would like to flush out those sections a lot more as in the future, if we decided to create a new version for the mobile side, it would help to have preliminary research into that topic. Also, the client wanted to know their options and having more knowledge on why it would not work would be helpful if they had pushback and really wanted to go down that route.

### How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

We are creating the product for the client yes, but at the end of everything it is the user that will need to interact with the product. If it is exceptionallyt difficult to use, has a bunch of bugs, or is difficult to get a hold of, then the product will fail and we will have a rather unhappy client, no matter how well we coded the project. This means that the user's needs are just as important as the client's wants and needs. For instance, we needed this program to work on all types of computers as we know that there are many different servers and brands. A lot of users may have Macs, but what about those that have Windows, or Microsoft, or Alienware? Similarly, what if they don't have access to a regular computer and will be operating off of their phone? All of these and more thoughts need to be taken into account when designing software.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When I was going through all of the FIXME comments for the design part of this project, I thought it would be best to do them document by document. This meant that sometimes when I thought that I had fixed or typed up a section correctly, it would not run yet as I had yet to attack the FIXME that it would call from. I would take more time to go through and figure out which order to tackle tasks would make the most logical sense, taking more time upfront, but cutting down on overall project hours in the long run.
